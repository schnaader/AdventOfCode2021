C++ Solutions for [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com/) year 2021 puzzles

No clean code or best practices here, I just tried to freshen up my modern C++ skills.

To compile, this should work for all puzzles (actually, C++20 is only needed for a few, C++11 should be enough for most):

`g++ -O2 -std=c++20 puzzleXY_Z.cpp -opuzzleXY_Z`
